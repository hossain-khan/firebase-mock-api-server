# firebase-mock-api-server
A simple mock API server using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) that is hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Why custom mock server
You have full control of what API to define and what data to respond with with minimal coding.

## How it works
See medium article https://link.medium.com/OAjz9kkV0U on how to setup firebase project and setup mock server.

## Show me examples
The APIs are defined via Express.js framework and served though Firebase cloud functions. All the defined API can be found at 👉 **[functions/index.js](https://github.com/amardeshbd/firebase-mock-api-server/blob/master/functions/index.js)** 👈
and pre-loaded mock responses example can be found at [mock-responses](https://github.com/amardeshbd/firebase-mock-api-server/tree/master/functions/mock-responses)

#### Large list of photos response from mocked JSON file
https://mock-apis-server.firebaseapp.com/photos

#### Single photo item from mocked JSON file
https://mock-apis-server.firebaseapp.com/photos/29647

#### Use :fire: Firebase Firestore database
Using firebase [console](https://console.firebase.google.com) you can easily update the database values
to reflect new values in realtime without needing to touch JSON source files.
